# Python Challenge

This is a two part challenge. Both parts involve reading from a CSV file, doing what needs to be done, and then writing to a text file. 

For the first part, I was tasked with analysing very basic financial records to compare profit and loss over a period of time. Here I learned how to read from the CSV file, manipulate lists, and write to a text file. For loops and if statements were used to capture and compare the data.

For the second part, I was tasked with counting votes in a local election to determine the winner. I used dictionaries to organize the data. I then used keys to access and manipulate the information stored within the dictionary. I also learned about the 'not in' function which was very useful. 

I really enjoyed this challenge. For the first part, I was able to check my work by using Excel. This gave me the confidence in my script I needed to be able to do the second part without Excel. As the second file was considerably larger than the first.

In the Extras sections, I took some employee information into a dataframe and changed it to be more esthetically pleasing. I was probably supposed to do this in VSC, but I didn't start until after being introduced to Jupyter Notebook and Pandas, and I wanted more practice with that so I did it that way instead.
